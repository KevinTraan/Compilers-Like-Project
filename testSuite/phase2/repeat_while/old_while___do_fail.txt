PT's while___do statement has been changed to a repeat while ... end statement.
So the original PT syntax should not work
This results in the error "scan/parse error, line 2: syntax error at: while" when running ssltrace with -ei.

Expected result:
 .sProgram
 .sIdentifier
 .sParmEnd
 % .sNewLine
  .sBegin
  .sEnd
