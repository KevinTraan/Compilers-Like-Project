This tests the precedence level of pDoubleBar and pBar.
Since they are the same precedence level, the program is read left to right, and concatenates the string before performing repeat string operation.

Expected Result:
.sProgram
.sIdentifier
.sParmEnd
.sBegin
.sVar
.sIdentifier
.sInitialValue
    .sStringLiteral
    .sStringLiteral
    .sConcatenate
    .sInteger
    .sRepeatString
.sExpnEnd
.sEnd
