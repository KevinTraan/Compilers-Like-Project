Since pHash has a higher precedence thatn pBar, the sLength token is emitted after the second string literal is declared and before the sConcatenate token is emitted.

Expected Result:
.sProgram
.sIdentifier
.sParmEnd
.sBegin
.sVar
.sIdentifier
.sInitialValue
    .sStringLiteral
    .sStringLiteral
    .sLength
    .sConcatenate
.sExpnEnd
.sEnd
