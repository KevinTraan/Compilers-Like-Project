This tests the precedence level of pDoubleBar and pBar.
Since this is read left to right, the sConcatenate should be performed after the sRepeatString operation.

Expected Result:
.sProgram
.sIdentifier
.sParmEnd
.sBegin
.sVar
.sIdentifier
.sInitialValue
    .sStringLiteral
    .sInteger
    .sRepeatString
    .sStringLiteral
    .sConcatenate
.sExpnEnd
.sEnd
