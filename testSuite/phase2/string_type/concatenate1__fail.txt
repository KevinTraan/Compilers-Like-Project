There is an error on line 2 where the pBar is given: scan/parse error, line 2: syntax error at: |.
This is because constant declarations cannot allow for string operations (only variable declarations).

Expected Result:
.sProgram
.sIdentifier
.sParmEnd
.sBegin
.sConst
.sIdentifier
.sStringLiteral
.sEnd
