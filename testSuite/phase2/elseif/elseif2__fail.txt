There cannot be an else that is not following an if statement. Therefore, there is no valid block in this program.
The following syntax error is caught at line 2 because there is not a valid keyword: scan/parse error, line 2: syntax error at: else.

Expected Result:
 .sProgram
 .sIdentifier
 .sParmEnd
  .sBegin
  .sEnd
