This program includes an if statement within the elseif statement.
As expected, the second if statement should not be handled as a separate block, but is nested within the elseif block.
This is treated as a nested if statement block (not 2 separate blocks) so since there is a mismatch of end statements the following syntax error is caught: scan/parse error, line 6: unexpected end of file.

Expected Result:
.sProgram
.sIdentifier
.sParmEnd
.sBegin
.sIfStmt
    .sIdentifier
    .sInteger
.sGT
.sExpnEnd
.sThen
.sBegin
.sNullStmt
.sEnd
.sElse
.sBegin
.sIfStmt
    .sIdentifier

.sThen
    .sBegin
    .sNullStmt
    .sIfStmt
        .sIdentifier
