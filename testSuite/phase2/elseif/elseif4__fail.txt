Since the declaration/statement within the else statement is invalid.
However, since we reach the end of an if statement anyway, a valid token stream is emitted.
The following syntax error is caught because the end keyword is given but a semicolon is expected: scan/parse error, line 6: syntax error at: end

Expected Result:
.sProgram
.sIdentifier
.sParmEnd
.sBegin
.sIfStmt
    .sIdentifier
    .sInteger
.sEq
.sExpnEnd
.sThen
.sBegin
    .sAssignmentStmt
    .sIdentifier
    .sIdentifier
        .sInteger
    .sAdd
    .sExpnEnd
.sEnd
.sElse
.sBegin
    .sAssignmentStmt
    .sIdentifier
    .sIdentifier
        .sInteger
    .sAdd
