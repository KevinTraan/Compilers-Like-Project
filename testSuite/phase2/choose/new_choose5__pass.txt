This is the case where no declaration or statement is given in a case alternative.
After sLabelEnd is emitted, there is no content between the sBegin and sEnd block.
This is still a valid program.

Expected Result:
.sProgram
.sIdentifier
.sParmEnd
.sBegin
.sCaseStmt
    .sIdentifier
.sExpnEnd
    .sInteger
.sLabelEnd
    .sBegin
    .sEnd
.sCaseEnd
.sEnd
