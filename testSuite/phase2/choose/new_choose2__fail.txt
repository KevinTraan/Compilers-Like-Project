Even without the proper use of the "end" keyword in this choose statement block, the way the rules are written in parser.ssl allow for the sEnd token to be emitted.
However, there is a syntax error caught at line 5 when the file ends, because the expected end keyword is missing: scan/parse error, line 5: unexpected end of file

Expected Result:
.sProgram
.sIdentifier
.sParmEnd
.sBegin
.sCaseStmt
    .sIdentifier
.sExpnEnd
    .sInteger
.sLabelEnd
    .sBegin
    .sNullStmt
    .sEnd
.sCaseEnd
.sEnd
