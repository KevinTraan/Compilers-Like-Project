The case where no case alternative is written, the CaseStmt rule is called, but the CaseAlternative rule is never reached. 
The when keyword is expected where the end keyword is given, so a syntax error is caught at line 3: scan/parse error, line 3: syntax error at: end

Expected Result:
.sProgram
.sIdentifier
.sParmEnd
.sBegin
.sCaseStmt
.sIdentifier
.sExpnEnd
.sCaseEnd
.sEnd
