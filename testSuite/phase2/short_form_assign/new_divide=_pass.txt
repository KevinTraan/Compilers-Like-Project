Add parsing for new Like short form assignment /=
Outputs the same output stream as the regular assignment to save work during semantic phase

Expected result:
 .sProgram
 .sIdentifier
 .sParmEnd
 % .sNewLine
  .sBegin
   .sAssignmentStmt
   .sIdentifier
   .sIdentifier
       .sInteger
   .sDivide
   .sExpnEnd
  .sEnd
