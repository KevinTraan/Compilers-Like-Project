A valid Like program must start with the keyword "using" followed by one or more identifiers.
Starting with anything other than this will result in a syntax error.

Running this test results in the error: "scan/parse error, line 1: syntax error at: /" 
when running ssltrace with -ei, and syntax error recovery is invoked.

Expected output:

 .sProgram
 .sIdentifier
 .sParmEnd
  .sBegin
  .sEnd
