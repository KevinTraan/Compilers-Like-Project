A variable declared like another variable that is undeclared is an invalid declaration.

Expected error when run with -ei flag command "./runTests3.sh i":

    #eUndefinedIdentifier
    semantic error, line 2: identifier not declared

when the semantic analyzer gets to the sIdentifier token representing "x".
